# March 2023

This month I joined a new team where I am to work alongside another DevOps Engineer to support in moving Integrations Monitoring & Alerting stack to use Grafana. I spent time settling in with the team and completing small tasks like version changes to aid my understanding off the workflow and release process. I also spent several weeks on courses such as Proffessional Scrum Master, Certified Kubernetes Administrator, and DevOps Engineering on AWS. By attending these courses I have achieved the Proffessional Scrum Master I certification from scrum.org and I have a voucher for an exam for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification from linuxfoundation.org which I aim to complete some time in the near future.

### Off the Job
