# July 2023

This month I made start on a proof of concept of moving our monitoring & alerting stack over to the ECS module. To begin I started creating the required infrastructre within a seperate AWS account. This included a VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets with a private hosted zone. I also spent some time configuring this new account to work with Integrations shared pipelines. This meant deploying a pipeline-iam project into this account which would deploy all the neccessary roles and policies to be assumed in those pipelines. After this an error arose with our existing monitoring and alerting stack where prometheus ran out of storage space causing it to no longer send alerts through alertmanager to slack. This was fixed by simply redeploying prometheus however it was noted that we needed to make sure that if this happened again, we would be notified. So I started working on an external alert system which would notify us if Alertmanager was no longer sending alerts. My plan for this is to add an API Gateway endpoint as a receiver in alertmanager, this endpoint would trigger a Lambda, then I could set up a cloudwatch alarm on that lambda to notify us if it is not triggered atleast once per day. 

### Off the Job

This month off the job I have mostly spent my time working on my project brief and dedicating the rest to working on the M&A fix that arose.
