# 15th - 19th of August

I continued practicing with helm and kubernetes this week. I spent some time creating a wordpress site with persistant storage, deploying it on a kubernetes cluster, then redeploying it using a helm chart.

### Off the Job

I am currently working on the following courses and reading the following books:

- A Cloud Guru - AWS Solutions Architect
- A Cloud Guru - Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- Udemy        - Python: 100DaysOfCode
- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Page 100
