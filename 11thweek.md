# 18th - 22th of July


### Off the Job

This week I continued working through the Solutions Architect Certification Prep course on A Cloud Guru and completed a number of practice questions. I also continued working on the Python 100 DaysOfCode challenge, the progress for which can be seen on my associated repo. I also spent sometime working through a Certified Kubernetes Administrator course and a Pluralsight Helm course as I know I will be working with these tools soon.
