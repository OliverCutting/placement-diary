# 19th - 23rd of September

This week I continued working researching Prometheus and Grafana. I found a github repo called prometheus-community which hosts a variety of ready made setups for prometheus/grafana including many different types of exporters. I implemented their kube-prometheus-stack into our migration project and was able to see all the metrics we require using this. I then decided to try and understand prometheus more by implementing it in my WordpressCluster, and adding a MySQL exporter to see metris for my MySQL server.
