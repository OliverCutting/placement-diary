  # 6th - 10th of June
  
  This week my team started our 3rd sprint. The first task I picked up was IDT-8695: CI/CD pipeline for deploying all components. I picked this task up with Adam another apprentice as we felt it was quite a large task and we both wanted to get the experience of working on it. Prior to this sprint another colleague had already planned out a skeleton pipeline for use to base our pipeline off of, as seen below.
