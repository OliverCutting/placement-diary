# May 2023

This month I worked on a somewhat large ticket which involved moving the config for the Cloudwatch exporter for prometheus out from the prometheus repo it sat in, and into its own repo so that we could update the config more easily without having to go through the lengthy deploy process for prometheus. This involved creating a pipeline which would push changes to the files in the repo up to an S3 bucket and working with Ansible and a bash script to sync files on the cloudwatch exporter container with it. I was able to reuse a lot of code from a repo which is used to sync alert rules for alertmanage to s3 in a similar fasion which helped speed up the ticket a lot. I also worked on a small ticket which involved altering the terraform for prometheus and alertmanager to remove the port numbers from the end of the urls to make it easier for new users to access them. All this involved was changing the port number which the load balancer was listening on to port 80. While doing this for alertmanager I noticed a previous feature I implemented was no longer working (high availability cluster). This was because some work had been done to the proxy which appeared to mistakenly attached the proxy port number to the proxy url twice (url.com:8080:8080) which meant no traffic could flow between the alertmnaager instances.

### Off the Job

This month for Off the job training I traveled down to London for GrafanaLive London which was a 1 day event organised by Grafana which gave me a lot of new insight into one of the primary tools I currently work with as part of our monitoring stack. I also learned about really interesting ways Grafana can work with some of their other tools such as Tempo, Loki, and Mirmir.

I am currently working on the following courses and reading the following books:

- A Cloud Guru - AWS Solutions Architect - 61%
- A Cloud Guru - Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator - 40%
- A Cloud Guru - Certified Kubernetes Administrator - 36.5%
- A Cloud Guru - Linux Networking and Troubleshooting - 13.6%
- Alan Hohn    - The Book of Kubernetes - Page 115
- [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) - Understanding Different OS Concepts
