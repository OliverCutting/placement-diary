# April 2023

This month I picked up a new ticket which involved implementing high availability for Alertmanager in our M&A stack. This ticket involved gaining lots of new understanding on tools such as Ansible and a deeper understanding of how our M&A stack works. In order to implement it I had to edit our shared terraform modules to allow for the opening of a new port for Alertmanager cluster peering. I then had to edit the Ansible role to put in dummy values for cluster.peer IP address and cluster.advertise-address, which I could write a script to dynamically change the values to current correct addresses for each Alertmanager instance. This took quite a bit of time to complete due to how Terraform works with scripts created using templates, and also due to the amount of time it takes to deploy test instances because of lengthy deployment pipelines. After recent discussions with other Engineers working on the M&A team I have found out that this is something we are planning to improve very soon. I have also booked onto some new events such as Grafana Live London which shall be incredibly useful with my new work involving Grafana.
