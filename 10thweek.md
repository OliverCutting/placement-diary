# 11th - 15th of July

This week I returned from a 2 week holiday and spent a lot of time catching up on the progress my team had made while I was absent. I then started working on fixing one of the security concerns raised by tfsec. The concern was rated as a high level risk and was caused by our sns topic message not being encrypted when sent to the lambda. Unfortunately I was unable to resolve this issue by the end of the week and will continue it next week.


### Off the Job

This week I continued working through the Solutions Architect Certification Prep course on A Cloud Guru and completed a number of practice questions. I also continued working on the Python 100 DaysOfCode challenge, the progress for which can be seen on my associated repo. Lastly I enrolled in the Automate Everything with Python Udemy course.
