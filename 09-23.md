# September 2023

This month I spent a lot of my time working on my project brief, apprenticeship assessments, and gathering things I needed for my gateway folder. Outside of this apprenticeship work I spent all of my time continuing my teams work on our M&A PoC. I started by adding our old M&A resources as datasources to our new Grafana so that we could migrate all of our dashboards and data to the new stack. This presented some new issues though as the PoC is in a seperate AWS account so we had to decide how to connect those accounts. In the end we decided we would connect to transit gateway as a spoke and communicate to the other account through the transit gateway. This required talks with architecture to gain approval. We also discussed with architecture pros and cons of the new stack and showed how the new stack would allow teams to keep all their own resources (prometheus, alertmanager) and send their date through those resources to the centralised stack if they wish to do so, or get rid of them and use the new centralised stack directly. I also spent a lot of time working on seting up a simple proxy in the account, and creating a new monitoring overview dashboard for grafana to display cluster level metrics in a variety of ways to show teams what they can do with grafana visualisations.
