# 5th - 9th of September

This week I continued working on my migration project for DWP. I made the pipeline more comprehensive and suitable for the job, adding in code to re build and publish the docker image whenever the Dockerfile gets updated. I done this using Buildah and a snippet of code I found in DWPs back catalog. I also looked into a tool called Flux which I will be using further into the project

### Off the Job

I am currently working on the following courses and reading the following books:

- A Cloud Guru - AWS Solutions Architect
- A Cloud Guru - Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- Udemy        - Python: 100DaysOfCode
- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Page 100
