# 1st - 5th of August

This week I recieved my first briefing on my upcoming project where I am tasked with migrating NTC-G onto EKS. Because of my lack of experience with kubernetes and helm I spent all week working on my understanding of these tools and deploying practice helloworld applications. I also was given access to the original documentation for NTC-G and spent a lot of time familiarising myself on its current setup. Even though I will be changing all of the current AWS set up(removing vpcs subnets etc to put the app on EKS) I still found it useful to see how these services were previously used.
