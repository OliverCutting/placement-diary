# January 2023

This month I spent a lot of time continuing my migration project with DWP, with my primary focus being creating a redeployable temporary environment for my team to use for testing. I used terraform to deploy a kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS and made use of Make to create a set of simple commands to be used to manage it locally. I made use of terraform workspaces to generate unique names for AWS resources and allow multiple users to access the terraform statefile simultaneously without issue. I set this up in a seperate repo to make the testing cluster reusable so I also created a basic pipeline for it which performs linting of terraform code and static analysis using KICS.

I also continued my work on the NTCG helm chart but hit blockers when trying to improve the application config as I need to speak with one of the devs who worked on the application for insight. I also added an option to deploy a stub for NTCG to the cluster for testing purposes but hit blockers after deploying it when trying to make use of the stub.

Most recently I have attending meetings with Integrations Monitorying and Alerting team who I am potentially going to be working alongside to help develop a new M&A solution using Prometheus & Grafana, a tech stack I have had experience working with on my migration project.
