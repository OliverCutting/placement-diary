# January 2023

This month I spent a lot of time continuing my migration project with DWP, with my primary focus being creating a redeployable temporary environment for my team to use for testing. I used terraform to deploy a kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS and made use of Make to create a set of simple commands to be used to manage it locally. I made use of terraform workspaces to generate unique names for AWS resources and allow multiple users to access the terraform statefile simultaneously without issue.
