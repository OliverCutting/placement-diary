# February 2023

This month my teams project on NTCG reached a standstill due to issues out of our control, so I spent a lot of my time working on my own personal development. I have attended courses on Python Programming , a cyber security course called Hack Yourself First and a RedHat course called Super Plumber Bros. I also attended RedHat Summit 2023 in London where I learned a lot about RedHat OpenShift and its potential use cases in my own work.

### Off the Job

I am currently working on the following courses and reading the following books:

- A Cloud Guru - AWS Solutions Architect - 61%
- A Cloud Guru - Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator - 40%
- A Cloud Guru - Certified Kubernetes Administrator - 33%
- A Cloud Guru - Linux Networking and Troubleshooting - 13.6%
- Alan Hohn    - The Book of Kubernetes - Page 115
