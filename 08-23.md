  # August 2023

I started off this month by creating an alerting system which would notify my team when our monitoring & alerting stack stops sending alerts. I accomplished this by creating an empty lambda & adding its endpoint as a receiver for Alertmanager's daily alert. This means whenever Alertmanager push the daily alert, it will trigger the lambda and give us something measurable on AWS. I then setup a Cloudwatch Alarm to trigger whenever this lambda is not evoked within 24 hours. I then wrote a second lambda which would send a notification to the appropriate Slack channel when the alarm is triggered. Finally I spent some time making the code reusable for other teams in their stacks. I spent the latter part of this month working alongside my colleagues on our ECS PoC, and trying to get a better understanding of one of the components deployed in this PoC, Blackbox Exporter. I spent sometime researching what it can do and trying to configure it in our PoC.
