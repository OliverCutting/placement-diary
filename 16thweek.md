# 22nd - 26th of August

This week I started working on NTCG a little bit and trying to figure out what some first steps would be for my team. I started by looking at the existing NTCG service and figuring out how to run the java application. I then did some work with Helm subcharts. And finally I created some basic container images and a dummy pipeline to test out various Kubernetes testing and linting tools.

### Off the Job

I am currently working on the following courses and reading the following books:

- A Cloud Guru - AWS Solutions Architect
- A Cloud Guru - Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- Udemy        - Python: 100DaysOfCode
- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Page 100
