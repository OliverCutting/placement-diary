# 25th - 29th of July

On Thursday this week I was invited to a meetup for all DevOps Engineers within the Integration team. At this meetup different people would present a topic of their choice, work related or not, so other people could get new ideas and inspiration for their work. This helped facilitate knowledge sharing within our community as we all showed off and shared snippets of code which could be reused across different projects. My team presented the project we had been working on for the past few weeks as everyone was interested in seeing how we were doing. We created 2 presentations, one which would outline the product and give devs information on how to use it and what it done etc. The other was more focused on our experience working on it and was where we shared interesting things we had found.

### Off the Job

This week I continued working through the Solutions Architect Certification Prep course on A Cloud Guru and completed a number of practice questions. I also continued working on the Python 100 DaysOfCode challenge, the progress for which can be seen on my associated repo. I also spent sometime working through a Certified Kubernetes Administrator course and a Pluralsight Helm course as I know I will be working with these tools soon.
