# 3rd - 7th of October

This week I worked on adding the NFS storage capabilities to NTCG. Due to not having access to the NFS storage yet I wasn't confident in my setup due to lack of testing so I put this ticket to one side for now. At the end of the week my team split our current workload into different parts and assigned each part to someone to sort of act as its product manager. I picked up the NTCG application workload and began working on implementing a script to automatically inject certs into the application container.
