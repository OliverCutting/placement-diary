# June 2023

This month I worked on many tickets, most notably creating an ACM module, which is a module to generate certificates for aws resources, and migrating the existing Cloudwatch Dashboards configuration out of the old monitoring repo and into a stand alone repo in the M&A group to make it easier for those who need them to update them without lengthy pipelines. I also spent a lot of time discussing with the other DevOps Engineers in the M&A team about the future of our stack. We are currently planning on moving our stack over to ECS using a module created by an external team. However we are still in discussions about how we want to deploy Grafana, whether it be Amazon managed Grafana, Grafana Enterprise, or Grafana Cloud.

### Off the Job

This month for Off the job training I went back to London for AWS Summit. This was a massive day long event which had many learning sessions on and lots of showcase stands for different companies to show of their tools and what they can do. I spoke with people developing all kinds of security tools, CI/CD tools and more to learn what they can do differently to the tools I am currently using.

I am currently working on the following courses and reading the following books:

- A Cloud Guru - AWS Solutions Architect - 61%
- A Cloud Guru - Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator - 40%
- A Cloud Guru - Certified Kubernetes Administrator - 36.5%
- A Cloud Guru - Linux Networking and Troubleshooting - 13.6%
- Alan Hohn    - The Book of Kubernetes - Page 115
- [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) - Understanding Different OS Concepts
